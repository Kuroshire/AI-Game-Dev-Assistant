# What's the goal with this app :

Make a small desktop assistant that will remind you to do small tasks you asked for (hydrate yourself, take medicines, go for groceries, etc).
Have a small customizable character you can interact with with basic actions (give it furniture to use, give it accessories, make it do actions like sport/read book/sleep/etc).
Bonus : Has a XP bar with level up and some sort of currency to buy new things and be able to customize more your little assistant.
